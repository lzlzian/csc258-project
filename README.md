# CSC258 Project

A simple wack-a-mole game written in Verilog HDL as a project for CSC258 Summer 2016,

by Huiyang Lu (contact: luhy559@gmail.com) and Yushan Lin (contact: yushanlin96@gmail.com)


/* 

The game concept started as using a hydrolic press to crush garbages, hence the hammer is referred to as a 'press' in the code, and the mole as a 'garbage'.

vga_\*.\* files and black.mif are VGA controller files provided by the course instructor.
